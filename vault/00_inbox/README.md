# Inbox

## Purpose

Fast capture only. No organizing during capture.

## Folder layout

- `capture/` for raw incoming notes
- `to_process/` for notes waiting weekly review

## Naming

Use natural names, no numeric prefix required (example: `meeting-notes-client-a.md`).

## Rule

Process inbox weekly and move notes into Projects, Areas, Resources, or Archive.
