# Development Tooling

This folder contains development-only tooling and setup helpers.

## Layout

- `setup/` - machine/bootstrap scripts for contributors.

## Available scripts

- `setup/install-debian.sh` - bootstrap a Debian-based development machine.

These scripts are intended for developers, not for managing a running PocketBrain instance.
