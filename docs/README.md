# Documentation

This folder contains all documentation for the PocketBrain workspace.

## Sections

- `architecture/` - repository layout contracts and architectural guidance.
- `runbooks/` - deployment and operations guides.

## Rule

When adding a new doc, place it in `docs/` (or a subfolder) instead of keeping docs in ad-hoc locations at the repository root.
