# Documentation 📚

Project documentation is organized by intent:

- 🏗️ `architecture/` repository and system design
- 🛠️ `setup/` developer onboarding and local workflows
- 🚀 `deploy/` runtime deployment guides
- 🧯 `runbooks/` operational procedures and incident response

All commands in docs assume execution from repository root.

- Repository contract: `docs/architecture/repository-structure.md`
- Security threat model: `docs/architecture/security-threat-model.md`

## Agent Skills 🤖
