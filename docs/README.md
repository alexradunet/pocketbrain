# Documentation

Project documentation is organized by intent:

- `architecture/` repository and system design
- `setup/` developer onboarding and local workflows
- `deploy/` runtime deployment guides
- `runbooks/` operational procedures and incident response

All commands in docs assume execution from repository root.

## Agent Skills

Operational knowledge is also externalized as OpenCode-compatible skills under:

- `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`

See `docs/setup/agent-skills.md` for the current skill catalog and usage guidance.
