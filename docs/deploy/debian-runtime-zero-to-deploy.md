# Debian Runtime Zero-to-Deploy

This is a short entry point. The canonical runtime deploy workflow lives in runbooks.

## Canonical references

- First-time install workflow: `docs/runbooks/runtime-install.md`
- Host hardening and VPS setup: `docs/deploy/secure-vps-and-run-pocketbrain.md`

## Quick pointer

Use `docs/runbooks/runtime-deploy.md` for all command steps (build, `.env`, start, logs, service enablement, and updates).
